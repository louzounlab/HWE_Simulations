First calculate {p(i)}
calculate {P_a(i,j)}
z(i.j)= sum_k (person k has (i,j))
calculate propabilities for every person k p_k(i,j) according to uncertainty.
O(i,j) = sum_k p_k(i,j)

every point in the plot:
x value: (Z(i,j) - N * P_a(i,j)) ^ 2
y value: (O(i,j) - N * P_a(i,j)) ^ 2

In this plot we try to show how much error we have in the unmerator in the Chi-Squared test
